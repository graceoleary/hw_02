# STA 323 & 523 :: Homework 02

## Introduction

Writing clean and elegant code is more that just following a specific style. It
involves a continuous work-flow of rewriting, restructuring, and rethinking how
your code functions. Homework 02 will get you started on the journey of
developing code that smells good.

## Tasks

### Part I

Tasks 1 and 2 will give you some more background information and prepare you
to successfully complete Part II.

#### Task 1

- Read sections [13.1 - 13.4](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) in Advanced R by
  Hadley Wickham.

- Watch [Code Smells and Feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY) by
  Jenny Bryan. Her slides and related materials are available on GitHub
  [here](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels).

#### Task 2

As a team, agree on a common coding style, you still must be consistent in your
style and syntax. Refresh yourself with the code style resources provided in
Homework 01.

### Part II

Read through Tasks 3 - 6 to get an idea of Part II's purpose. One working
example for inspiration of an S3 class is given by the "Roman" class.
See `?utils::as.roman()`.

#### Task 3

Create a new class for the S3 object-oriented system. For your class, include
constructor, validator, and helper functions as explained in section 13.3 of
<i>Advanced R</i>.

#### Task 4

Create methods for your newly defined class in Task 3. Those enrolled in 323
must develop two methods, and those enrolled in 523 must develop three methods.
These methods should either use existing generic functions such as `print()`,
`summary()`, `plot()`, etc; or you may create a new generic function. If
you do create your own generic function, be sure to include a default method
to ensure best practices. Function `sloop::is_S3_generic()` can help you
identify which `base` R functions are S3 generics.

#### Task 5

Demonstrate your class and methods with at least two examples for each method.
Thus, you should have at least four or six examples total, depending on if you
are enrolled in 323 or 523.

#### Task 6

Provide a concise write-up that explains your class and methods.

## Essential details

### Deadline and submission

**The deadline to submit Homework 02 is Wednesday, February 10 at 11:59pm ET.**
Only your final commit and code in the main branch will be graded.
To submit, push your work to your assigned team repository on GitHub before
the deadline.

### Help

- Post your questions in the #hw2 channel on Slack. Explain your error / problem
  in as much detail as possible or give a reproducible example that generates
  the same error. Make use of the code snippet option available in Slack. You
  may also send a direct message to the instructor or TAs.

- Visit the instructor or TAs in Zoom office hours.

- The instructor and TAs will not answer any questions about this assignment
 	within six hours of the deadline.

### Academic integrity

This is a team assignment. You may communicate with other teams in the
course. As a reminder, any code you use directly or as inspiration must be
cited.

To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.

dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the Duke
Community Standard, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a
0 grade for all parties involved as well as being reported to the University
